# REACT REDUX SHOPPING CART

Practice on the use of Redux without the use of tools or libraries such as Redux Toolkit or Redux Saga. In this practice, only Redux's own tools will be used.

You can find a much simpler practice in the following repository:
https://github.com/newmanferrer/react-redux-counter.git

## Project description

In this project we will advance one more step in the complexity of our states. We will build and simulate a shopping cart that will help us a little more in the process of understanding the use of Redux and the tools it offers us.

We will be able to observe the proposed folder structure that we could use to organize our code and components. In this sense, this structure is based on projects that can have many more components and states.

Our application itself, as I mentioned, will be a little more advanced than the previous counter. It will allow us to increase the complexity in managing our state by having more available options managed by our reducer. We will control the products and their available quantities, as well as our shopping cart and an option to show more details of our product, which also manages the available quantity. I hope that with this practice I can help other people to understand how Redux works.
